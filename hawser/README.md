###Hawser

A hawser is a cable used to anchor a ship. It seems appropriate 
for a software preservation
experiment 
 
A research piece of code to check a Dockerfile against 
rules set up, before extracting the processes and environment 
used with a linked workflow from [Kliko](https://github.com/gijzelaerr/kliko)

This is research code to look at the long term sustainability
of Dockerfiles as part of a workflow.
